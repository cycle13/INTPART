## Description
Sea ice observations were taken from a one-week field school on board the R/V Lance, which traveled to the marginal ice zone northwest of Longyearbyen, Svalbard in May of 2017 (18-24th). Analysis validates in situ observations with the high-resolution AMSR2 (UAH 3.125 km) sea ice concentration product.

## Data
```sea ice concentration (SIC)``` - AMSR2 (ASI 3.125 km, UAH-processed)

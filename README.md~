## Description
Changes in Arctic sea ice extent and concentration are well documented within the satellite record (1979). However, quantifying pan-Arctic sea ice thickness and volume is challenging as a result of limited observations until recently through ICESat (2003-2009) and CryoSat-2 (2011-present). The Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) is a POP ocean and sea ice model that has been widely validated in reproducing a sea ice thickness and volume record consistent with the spatial and temporal variability of our limited observations. This project will provide a comprehensive overview of long-term trends and variability in sea ice volume using PIOMAS in addition to ICESat/CryoSat-2. We are particularly interested in the the distribution of sea ice and regional trends, which may be important for feedbacks with the large-scale atmospheric circulation.
